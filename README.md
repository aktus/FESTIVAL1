==================
Setup
-----

- You should edit the `database.sample.yml` file, to your Postgres configuration.
- You should create/migrate/seed the data.
- You should run the test suite to assure everything is O.K.


###Configuration (in the root dir, lol)
- `mv config/database.sample.yml config/database.yml`
- `vi config/database.yml` (change `vi` to your favorite editor)

####Migration:
- `rake db:create db:migrate db:seed` to prepare the app db
- `rake db:test:prepare` - to prepare the test db


####Running
- `rails s -p 3000` (you have to set the port to 3000 due to Facebook/Omniauth access)

####YAML files
- `vi config/config.yml` to set up the facebook auth and other configurations.

Test
----

### Guard

** WARNING **

- Due to some problem I don't recognize, the `guard` tests are failing. Use the manual way, after running `rake db:test:prepare`

- Just type `guard` and this will run all the tests for you. And if you are working on some feature, open a new tab with `guard` and let the tests flow ‚ù§ .




### Manual way ~
- `rspec spec/` to run RSpec (Controller/Models/etc) tests
- `cucumber` to run cucumber tests
- `rake jasmine` to run jasmine (Javascript) tests **WARNING - using gem jasminerice to jasmine tests**

#### JasmineRice
As we're using the Gem JasmineRice, you just need to bootup the server (`rails s -p 3000`) and then
access the tests through the URL [http://localhost:3000/jasmine](http://localhost:3000/jasmine)
